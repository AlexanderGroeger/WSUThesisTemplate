# WSU Thesis Template
This repository contains a set of files for LaTeX users writing thesis or dissertaions at *Wright State University*. There are a number of other WSUs. I apologize.

The LaTeX file itself should be self-documenting, so the user is left to their own to edit it and modify i with the contents of their thesis/dissertation. There is a bit of demoing of LaTeX that happens in the document, but no claims are made that it is sufficient to teach LaTeX.

If you find bugs, the best thing to to is fork the repository, correct the issue, then submit a pull request so that the template and other files may be improved. Incorporating your corrections is the best way to thank me and others who have worked on this so far.
