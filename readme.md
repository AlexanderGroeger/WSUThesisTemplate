#Wright State University LaTeX Thesis/Dissertation style file
This repository contains a set of files for LaTeX users writing thesis or dissertations at *Wright State University*. There are a number of other WSUs. I apologize.

The LaTeX file itself should be self-documenting, so the user is left to their own to edit it and modify it with the contents of their thesis/dissertation. There is a bit of demoing of LaTeX that happens in the document, but no claims are made that it is sufficient to teach LaTeX.

Use this and you will have a consistent document that meets Wright State University
guidelines. Don’t add your own formatting. Use only *structure* commands. For instance, *\emph* instead of *\textit*. 

If you find bugs, the best thing to to is fork the repository, correct the issue, then submit a pull request so that the template and other files may be improved. Incorporating your corrections is the best way to thank me and others who have worked on this so far. 

Every effort has been made to meet the Wright State University School of Graduate Studies Guidelines,
and this template may actually be good enough, however no warrantee is
expressed or implied. Things change, and the template will likely have to be continuously updated.

## Some Basic Introductions to LaTeX


These are, or will be, out of date, but are a good start in learning
LaTeX. Pick and choose as you need. Get the more updated documents from
[CTAN] (look for the dtx or tex file in the appropriate package) to get
the latest documents. Send me the new file and I’ll post it.
